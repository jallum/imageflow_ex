Elixir bindings for [Imageflow][imageflow-github], a safe and blazing fast image workflow library.

## Installation

Add the package to your `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:imageflow_ex, "~> 0.2.0"}
  ]
end
```

## Usage

There are two main ways of using `imageflow_ex`:

* `Imageflow.Graph`, which is the high-level graph-like API, inspired by [Imageflow.NET](https://github.com/imazen/imageflow-dotnet)
* `Imageflow.Native` which provibes lower-level access to Rust binding. Shouldn't be needed unless you need really specific features which aren't yet implemented in the Graph API (but please open an issue so the API can evolve).

Using the Graph API allows you to create processing pipelines to process your
images:


```elixir
alias Imageflow.Graph

Graph.new()
|> Graph.decode_file("input.png")     # read input.png
|> Graph.constrain(200, 200)          # constrain image to 200x200
|> Graph.saturation(0.5)              # set saturation to 0.5 (-1..1 range)
|> Graph.encode_to_file("output.png") # specify output file
|> Graph.run()                        # run the job
```

### Low-level API

This provides direct access to NIF bindings. You probably don't need this,
unless you're relying on APIs that are not yet supported by the Graph API
(please submit an issue).

Check `Imageflow.Native` for documentation and examples.
